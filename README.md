# simple-registry
## A simple gift registry for your guests

# Why?

Because my friend Patrick didn't want to pay to use other online registry services and asked me "can't you just make one for me?". 

So I thought about it and figured it would be a good exercise in full-stack dev and just maybe I could make the whole thing free to run on Heroku.

# How?

This app is based on [Angular-Fullstack](https://github.com/DaftMonk/generator-angular-fullstack) and as such you can use it's readme and build/deploy process.

To get simple-registry running locally do the following

1. clone the repo
2. run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. run `grunt serv` to run the server with development settings

# Deployment?

I'll figure this out eventually
